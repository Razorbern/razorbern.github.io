<br>
<b>Data Set Information:</b><br>
This data set includes hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally-controlled air-quality
monitoring sites. The air-quality data are from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring
Center. The meteorological data in each air-quality site are matched with the nearest weather
station from the China Meteorological Administration. The time period is from March 1st, 2013
to February 28th, 2017. Missing data are denoted as NA.<br>
