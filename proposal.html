<br>
<b>Data Set Information:</b><br>
This data set includes hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally-controlled air-quality
monitoring sites. The air-quality data are from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring
Center. The meteorological data in each air-quality site are matched with the nearest weather
station from the China Meteorological Administration. The time period is from March 1st, 2013
to February 28th, 2017. Missing data are denoted as NA.<br>

<b>Existing Analysis</b><br>
A quick Google search reveales several statistical analyses with Beijing air quality data, though the years and
content vary.<br>
<br>
<b>Proposal</b><br>
My original plan was to use the location of the stations to explore unsuperviced clustering techinques. But
as you can see from the map, there aren't well distributed nor are there enough of them. I'm pivoting 
to explore the relationships between the PM2.5 and windspeed/direction. I'll be exploring their relationships
withing the same station and I'll also group the stations in the urban areas with the stations in the suburbs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Geolocation</b><br>
I first found the geolocations of the stations and then used the ggmap library to map them.<br>
<br>
<pre>
    register_google(key = [google api key])

    data <- read_csv("data/station_locations.csv")
    
    myMap <- get_map(location=myLocation, maptype="roadmap", zoom=9)
    
    ggmap(myMap)+
    +     geom_point(aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), data = data, alpha=.5, color="blue", size=3)
</pre>
